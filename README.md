# FirstApp

This is a Java application that implements Lagrange interpolation and provides methods for parsing JSON data to extract points for interpolation. The application also includes unit tests to validate its functionality.

## Overview

The project consists of the following main components:
- **Lagrange Interpolation**: A method to find the value of a polynomial at a given point using known values.
- **JSON Parsing**: Uses the Gson library to read and interpret JSON data.
- **Unit Tests**: JUnit 5 is used to ensure the correctness of the methods.
